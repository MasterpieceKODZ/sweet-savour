# This is is a demo restuarant menu and order website project

**Discalimer** all data use in the project are not proven to be true in real world as this is only a demo project.

In this project I have used...

- React
- NextJS
- SASS
- REDUX
- SwiperJS
- Firebase
- fontawesome CSS
- Fontsource (vercel)
- Animate CSS

On a window or screen less than 501px the home page is a autoplay carousel showing some new dishes promotion and on larger screens _above 500px_ homepage is a grid layout dashboard also with promotion content

Each slide in the carousel and grid panel has a button that directs to the menulist page.
